# GoogleDataAnalyticsCapstoneProject
This is my first data analysis project, completed as part of the capstone project in the Google Data Analytics Course. 

In this file, I have applied some of the frameworks learn to help derive ingsights for data-driven decison making, primarily using the R programming language. Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyse, Share and Act. Each of these phases were considered when conducting the analaysis, with written doucmentation along with it. 

Being new to using the R programming language as a tool for analysis, its' application has been kept fairly simple; For example, summary statistics and the use of ggplot2 - as well as other common libraries.
